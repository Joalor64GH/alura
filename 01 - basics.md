# Əlura Basics
Əlura uses only soft sounds in the English IPA, so harsh or sharp phonemes are completely avoided. <br>
It also comes with its own special writing system.

This language also uses a different word order for phrases. <br>
So, instead of SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) in English, Əlura uses OSV (Object-Subject-Verb).
