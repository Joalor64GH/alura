# Əlura Basics
Əlura uses only soft sounds in the English IPA. <br>
This basically means that harsh or sharp phonemes are completely avoided.

It also comes with its own special writing system. <br>
The letters are designed to flow smoothly like the language itself.

This language also uses a different word order for phrases. <br>
So, instead of SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) in English, Əlura uses OSV (Object-Subject-Verb). <!-- okay yoda -->
