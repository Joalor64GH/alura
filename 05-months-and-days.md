## How to Write the Date
Writing the date in Əlura follows the Year-Month-Day format. <br>
For example, If you wanted to write "June 30, 2025", it would look like:
* "ðʊsɛnt͡ʃuɹi-ðʊʒɛi-fiθ / juni / θɛʒɛ"

Or:
* 2025 / 06 / 30

You also have to option to add in a day of the week at the beginning. <br>
That would look like:
* "munðɛi, ðʊsɛnt͡ʃuɹi-ðʊʒɛi-fiθ / juni / θɛʒɛ"
