# Əlura Basics
Əlura uses only soft sounds in the English IPA. <br>
And it comes with its own special writing system.

This language also uses a different word order for phrases. <br>
So, instead of SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) in English, Əlura uses OSV (Object-Subject-Verb). <!-- okay yoda -->

Also, if you're only writing the actual letters, everything has to be in lowercase.
