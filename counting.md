# Numbering System
I couldn't come up with any unique ideas, so Əlura uses a base 6 numbering system.

## Basic Numbers (0-10)
| English      | Əlura                   |
| :----------: | :---------------------: |
| zero         | ɔʒɛɹ                    |
| one          | ʌn                      |
| two          | ðʊ                      |
| three        | θɛ                      |
| four         | fɑɹ                     |
| five         | fiθ                     |
| six          | fiθ-ʌn (five and one)   |
| seven        | fiθ-ðʊ (five and two)   |
| eight        | fiθɹɛ (five and three)  |
| nine         | fiθ-fɑɹ (five and four) |
| ten          | ʌnʒɛ (one and zero)     |

## Beyond 10
For numbers past ten, you have to follow this structure: <br>
ʌnʒɛ (ten) + i (and) + [number]

So for eleven, it would be ʌnʒɛi-ðʊ (one and zero and two). <br>
This syntax also applies to other numbers in the tens place (20, 30, 40, etc).

| English       | Əlura                   |
| :-----------: | :---------------------: |
| eleven        | ʌnʒɛi-ʌn                |
| twelve        | ʌnʒɛi-ðʊ                |
| thirteen      | ʌnʒɛi-θɛ                |
| twenty        | ðʊʒɛ                    |
| thirty        | θɛʒɛ                    |
| fourty        | fɑɹʒɛ                   |
| fifty         | fiʒɛ                    |
| sixty         | ʌnfiʒɛ                  |
| seventy       | ðʊfiʒɛ                  |
| eighty        | θɛfiʒɛ                  |
| ninety        | fɑɹfiʒɛ                 |
| one hundred   | ʌnʒɛðivl (ten-ten)      |
| two hundred   | ðʊʒɛðivl (two-ten-ten)  |
| six hundred   | ʌnfiʒɛðivl              |
| seven hundred | ðʊfiʒɛðivl              |
| eight hundred | θɛfiʒɛðivl              |
| nine hundred  | fɑɹfiʒɛðivl             |
| one thousand  | ʌnʒɛθɹivl (ten-ten-ten) |

Of course, it's the same thing beyond one hundred and so on.

For example, the structure for 420 would be: <br>
fɑɹ (four) ʌnʒɛðivl (hundred) + i (and) + ðʊʒɛ (twenty)
