# Numbering System
I couldn't come up with any unique ideas, so Əlura uses a base 6 numbering system.

## Basic Numbers
| English      | Əlura                   |
| :----------: | :---------------------: |
| zero         | oʒɛɹ                    |
| one          | ʌn                      |
| two          | ðʊ                      |
| three        | θɛ                      |
| four         | fɑɹ                     |
| five         | fiθ                     |
| six          | fiθ-ʌn (five and one)   |
