# Counting
Əlura uses a base 6 numbering system.

## Basic Numbers (0-10)
| English | Əlura                   |
| :-----: | :---------------------: |
| zero    | ɔʒɛɹ                    |
| one     | ʌn                      |
| two     | ðʊ                      |
| three   | θɛ                      |
| four    | fɑɹ                     |
| five    | fiθ                     |
| six     | fiθ-ʌn (five and one)   |
| seven   | fiθ-ðʊ (five and two)   |
| eight   | fiθɹɛ (five and three)  |
| nine    | fiθ-fɑɹ (five and four) |
| ten     | ʌnʒɛ (one and zero)     |

## Beyond 10
For numbers past ten, you have to follow this structure: <br>
ʌnʒɛ (ten) + i (and) + [number]

So for twelve, it would be ʌnʒɛi-ðʊ (one and zero and two). <br>
This syntax also applies to other numbers in the tens place (20, 30, 40, etc).

| English  | Əlura    |
| :------: | :------: |
| eleven   | ʌnʒɛi-ʌn |
| twelve   | ʌnʒɛi-ðʊ |
| thirteen | ʌnʒɛi-θɛ |
| twenty   | ðʊʒɛ     |
| thirty   | θɛʒɛ     |
| fourty   | fɑɹʒɛ    |
| fifty    | fiʒɛ     |
| sixty    | ʌnfiʒɛ   |
| seventy  | ðʊfiʒɛ   |
| eighty   | θɛfiʒɛ   |
| ninety   | fɑɹfiʒɛ  |

## Beyond 99
We're basically out of numbers, so all we can do is simple repetition.

| English       | Əlura                  |
| :-----------: | :--------------------: |
| one hundred   | ʌnʒɛʌnʒɛ (ten-ten)     |
| two hundred   | ðʊʒɛʌnʒɛ (two-ten-ten) |
| six hundred   | ʌnfiʒɛʌnʒɛ             |
| seven hundred | ðʊfiʒɛʌnʒɛ             |
| eight hundred | θɛfiʒɛʌnʒɛ             |
| nine hundred  | fɑɹfiʒɛʌnʒɛ            |

Of course, numbers past one hundred follow the same structure from earlier.

For example, the structure for 420 would be: <br>
fɑɹ (four) + ʌnʒɛʌnʒɛ (hundred) + i (and) + ðʊʒɛ (twenty)

So it would look like: "fɑɹʒɛʌnʒɛi-ðʊʒɛ"

## Beyond 999
As a quick bonus, we're not actually out of numbers. <br>
We simply need to include a new unique number.
