# Grammar
**WORK IN PROGRESS**

## Gramatically Allowed Syllables
Any consonant combined with a vowel counts as a syllable. <br>
Some consonsants combined with another consonant also counts as a syllable. <br>
The same thing applies to a vowel combined with another vowel.

However, I've deemed the following gramatically incorrect:
* d͡ʒ + ð - There's literally no need
* j + [any other consonant] - Just no
* s + z, ʃ, ʒ - They make identical sounds
* t͡ʃ + ʃ - Really?
* ŋ + j - I don't like it 
* v + w - It just doesn't seem right
* [any consonant] + [the same consonant] - Found this one while making the counting system
* Literally any combination that doesn't sound good together - NO

## Sentence Examples
* "wæɹ mi-ɔvæ" | I have water.
    * "wæɹ" is water
    * "ɔvæ" is have
    * "mi" is I or me
* "ðʊ ðʊvɑsus ɛjɛi əɹ" | There are two animals.
    * "ðʊ" is two
    * "ðʊvɑsus" is animals
    * "ɛjɛi" is there
    * "əɹ" is are

## Prefixes
* "nɔu-" - The equivalent of "non-" in English
    * Example: "nɔu-iŋɑn" means "Non-human"
* "mɛu-" - Indicating a higher degree
    * Example: "mɛu-ðɑns" means "Many thanks" (Literal meaning: very thanks)

## Suffixes
* "-s" - Indicates more than one / plural
* "-ʃæ~ɛu" - Indicating desparation
